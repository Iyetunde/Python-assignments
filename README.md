# Python-assignments
I am currently taking a course in python, this is a proof of assignments completed during the course.
Exercise: Basic Python loops
In this notebook we will have the opportunity to solve some problems involving basic loops, helping you to master one of Python's core concepts.

Learning objectives
In this train we will learn:

How to create basic for and while loops
How to control the flow of loops
Exercises
Exercise 1: Basic for loop
Objective: Print each animal's name from the animals list using a for loop.

animals = ['Great White Shark', 'Blue Whale', 'African Elephant', 'Bald Eagle', 'Orangutan', 'Tiger', 'Panda', 'Koala']

# Write a for loop to print each animal's name
Exercise 2: while loop with condition
Objective: Use a while loop to print numbers from 0 to 4.

# Initialize a variable 'i' to 0

# Write a while loop that prints 'i' and increments it by 1 each time, until it reaches 4
Exercise 3: Using break in a loop
Objective: Stop the loop once you find Orangutan in the animals list.

# Write a for loop with a break statement to stop the loop when 'Orangutan' is found
Exercise 4: Using continue in a loop
Objective: Print all animals except 'Bald Eagle' using a for loop and continue statement.

# Write a for loop with a continue statement to skip 'Bald Eagle' and print other animals
Exercise 5: Using pass in a loop
Objective: Create a loop that does nothing when 'Panda' is encountered, but prints other animals.

# Write a for loop with a pass statement for 'Panda' and print other animals
